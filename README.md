# Mapping Earthquakes Analysis Overview

Use JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Leaflet to create an interactive visualization to map earthquake data by latitude and longitude from the USGS. Create data markers for each earthquake that will show the magnitude in popup marker text as well as a circle and color, where the circle size and color are larger and darker as the magnitude increases. Create a legend for the map where the color in the legend reflects the magnitude.

Create three different map type options (Streets, Satellite, Dark) each with three different overlay options (Tectonic Plates, Earthquakes, Major Earthquakes). Adjust the legend, circle sizes, and colors to accommodate Major Earthquakes layer data with magnitudes above 6.
